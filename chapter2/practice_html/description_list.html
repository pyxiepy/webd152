  <h1>Sample Description</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>TCP</dt>
    <dl>TCP is used together with IP to transmit files efficiently over the Internet. IP takes over after TCP creates the packets, using IP addressing to send each packet over the Internet using the best path at the particular time. When the destination address is reached, TCP verifies the integrity
      of each packet using the checksum, requests resend if a packet is damaged, and reassembles the file or message from the multiple packets.</dl>
    <dt>IP</dt>
    <dl>Working in harmony with TCP, IP is a set of rules that controls how data are sent between computers on the
      Internet. IP routes a packet to the correct destination address. Once sent, the packet gets successively forwarded to the next closest router (a hardware device designed to move network traffic) until it reaches its destination.</dl>
    <dt>FTP</dt>
    <dl>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a set of rules that allows files to be exchanged between computers on the
      Internet. Unlike HTTP, which is used by web browsers to request web pages and their associated files in order to display a web page, FTP is used simply to move files from one computer to another. Web developers commonly use FTP to transfer web page files from their computers to web servers.</dl>
    <dt>HTTP</dt>
    <dl>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules for exchanging files such as text, graphic images,
      sound, video, and other multimedia files on the Web. Web browsers and web servers usually use this protocol. When the user of a web browser requests a file by typing a website address or clicking a hyperlink, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the server. The web server in the destination machine receives the request, does any necessary processing, and responds with the requested file and any associated media files.</dl>
