<p>Teatime musings on Organic Assam Breakfast by Republic of Tea...
    Ah, breakfast. It starts before breakfast... with a tall, dark, steaming cup of hearty comfort
    to break your nightlong fast from reality, and gracefully ease your mind, body, and spirit
    into a calm, awakened, harmonious state. Gazing into the deep, dark body with hues of rich red is like
    gazing into the vast recesses of your own mind where the fire of consciousness has already begun
    creating your day from within. Breathing in the potential of your day ahead, the malty, roasted aroma
    invites your inner light to fill your body and stand firmly on the earth, empowered to bring forth
    your dreams into reality.
